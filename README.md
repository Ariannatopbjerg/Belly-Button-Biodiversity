# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project is to develop a dashboard to show a study on bacterial species within various individual navel cavities. Participants of this study can search for their personal ID number to see which types of bacterial species are living within their bellybuttons. Other researchers who are interested in this study can view the dashboard as well.
